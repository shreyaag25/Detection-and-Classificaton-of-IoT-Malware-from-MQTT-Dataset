# Detection-and-Classificaton-of-IoT-Malware-from-MQTT-Dataset

The exponential increase in the use of smart devices has also increased the possibility of malware in the dataset. To protect the data from cyber-attacks and malware, it is important to differentiate between legitimate and malicious data. Thus, this study emphasizes the significance of protecting smart devices from attacks and offers various machine-learning methods for identifying and categorizing malware.

In the project, different machine learning algorithms are proposed to detect and classify IoT malware from the MQTT dataset, a standard protocol for IoT messaging.

The different machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, CNN, Gradient Boost, Light GBM, and Naive Bayes are proposed and compared based on their accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

ðŸ”… CNN Convolutional Neural Network, a type of deep learning consists of an output layer, several hidden layers, and a single input layer. Convolutional layers, pooling layers, and non-linear activation levels make up the hidden layers. The fully connected output layer of the CNN produces a classification of the data based on its classes.

ðŸ”… Random Forest Random Forest machine learning algorithm, is a popular supervised learning method. It is a classifier that applies a number of decision trees to various dataset subsets and averages the results to improve the expected accuracy of the dataset. The random forest utilizes predictions from each decision tree and predicts the outcome based on the votes of the majority of projections rather than relying solely on one decision tree.

ðŸ”… Gradient Boost Gradient Boosting is a potent boosting approach that turns numerous weak learners into strong learners. Gradient descent is used to train each subsequent model to minimize the loss function of the one before it, such as mean square error or cross-entropy. It is a machine learning greedy algorithm technique used in regression and classification tasks. It is very intuitive to use, can handle missing values, outliers, and high cardinality categorical values on your features, and is powerful enough to identify any nonlinear relationship between your model goal and features.

ðŸ”… Light Gradient Boost Model The Light Gradient Boosting Model is a gradient boosting framework that makes use of the tree-based learning technique, which is regarded as a powerful computational approach. Light GBM is prefixed with "Light" because of its quick speed.

ðŸ”… NaÃ¯ve Bayes Model Using supervised machine learning, the Naive Bayes classifier performs classification tasks. Strong independence assumptions between the characteristics and the Bayes' Theorem of probability form its foundation.

The Random Forest technique came out to be the most effective technique as it has the greatest accuracy percentage and F1 score.
